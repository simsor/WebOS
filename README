WebOS is a web-based operating system.
Its aim is to provide a desktop accessible from everywhere.

It's fully written with JavaScript and HTML5, no Flash or tricky things like that, so you can use it on your iPhone (I think, if it doesn't work, please e-mail me).
It has an intuitive interface and it is designed to be beautiful and useful (who wants just a "design" and no content ?).

For the moment, this project isn't well advanced, it manages the windows (opening, resizing, minimizing and closing) and I am working on the SDK, which will help the developper to develop apps for WebOS.

And...I don't really like this name, WebOS. If you have an idea of a new one, could you send it to me :) ?
